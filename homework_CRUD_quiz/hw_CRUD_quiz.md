# CRUD Quiz

Use the solution to this afternoon's Property Tracker lab to answer the following questions. Please write your answers under each question, push the file to GitHub, and submit in the usual way.

## MVP Questions

In our Property Tracker application:

Q1. Where are we instantiating instances of the `Property` class?

<!-- In 'console.rb' -->

Q2. Where are we defining the SQL that enables us to save the ruby `Property` object into the database?

<!-- In 'property.rb' line 18 to 29. -->

Q3. In `console.rb`, which lines modify the database?

<!-- The database can be modified in the following ways;
In 'def save()' on line 16; by #creation
In 'def update()' on line 36; by #updating
In 'def delete()' on line 55; by #deletion
In 'def Property.delete_all' on line 101; by #deletion-->

Q4. Why do we not define the id of a `Property` object at the point we instantiate it (‘new it up’)?

<!-- Because the id of the 'Property' object is unique and created automatically and incremented with each instantiation. -->

Q5. Where and how do we assign the id (that is generated by the database) to the ruby `Property` object?

<!-- In the def 'save' #create instance method -->

Q6. Why do we put a guard (an `if` clause) on the `@id` attribute in the constructor?

<!-- This is placed incase the 'Property' object references an object that does not have an 'id' attribute -->

Q7. Why are some of the CRUD actions represented by instance methods, and others by class methods?

<!-- Because some methods require access to only instances of the class such as 'delete' and 'update' whereas some methods require access to the whole class, such as 'delete_all'. -->

Q8. What type of data structure is returned by calls to `db.exec_prepared()`? In the `save` method, how do we access the id from the returned data structure?

<!-- A hash inside of an array. we access array[0] and grab the "id" from the hash as an integer (INT). -->

Q9. Why do we use prepared statements when performing database operations?

<!-- The prepared statements help prevent SQL injection attacks. -->

## Extension Questions

Look at the `find_by_id` and `find_by_address` methods in the `Property` class.

Q10. What do they take in as their arguments?

<!-- 'find_by_id' takes in 'id' as its argument.
'find_by_address' method takes in 'address' as its argument. -->


Q11. What are their return values?

<!-- Return values are displayed in an array. -->
